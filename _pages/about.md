I am a final year M.Sc. student in Computer Science at [Northwestern Polytechnical University (西北工业大学)](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, advised by [Dr. Hui Yu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/yuhui.html). I have a Bachelor's degree in Software engineering from [Zhejiang Normal University (浙江师范大学)](http://zjnu.edu.cn/). 
My given Chinese name is 金小超 (Jīn Xiǎo Chāo). 


Research Interests
------
I am broadly interested in deep learning, but with special focus on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their applications** in various domains. 

Updates
