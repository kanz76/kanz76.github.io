I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Dr. Arlei Silva](https://cs.rice.edu/~al110/index.html). I received a Master's degree in Computer Science at [Northwestern Polytechnical University (西北工业大学)](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xi'an, China, under the supervision of [Dr. Hui Yu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/yuhui.html). I have a Bachelor's degree in Software engineering from [Zhejiang Normal University (浙江师范大学)](http://zjnu.edu.cn/). 
My Chinese name is 金小超 (Jīn Xiǎo Chāo). 


Research Interests
------
I am broadly interested in deep learning, but with special focus on **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their applications**.  Currently working on the application of GNNs to the prediction/emulation of extreme weather events such as flooding by designing **Physics-Informed/Inspired GNNs**.
